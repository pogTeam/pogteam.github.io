# Writeups

Writing writeups is the best way to both learn and teach. However, some guidelines should be observed when publishing your solutions.

1. Avoid mistakes. We know they happen, but we try to assure the quality of the content we produce. Ask for other players to review your solution before pushing it.

2. Write everything. Even your mistakes. Got stuck in a rabbit hole for hours? Write it down so other people do not do the same in the future.

3. Be honest. If you don't know, say it. Maybe somebody else will help you.

4. Be organized. If you are in a hurry, it is fine to write a small text, but do not make a mess out of it.
