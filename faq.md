# FAQ

# How it works

Everyone can speak, everyone can give opinions, everyone can act over pogTeam. Flat hierarchy.

# When do we play?

We follow CTFtime calendar and play the most we can.

# How do we play?

We have a Slack team for the contests. Every running contest we open new boards, one for each chall. If you have an idea, just throw it there, so someone else can continue from where you left. This way we avoid being stuck in challs. Also, timezone differences are not a big issue and makes writeups easier to do.

# Who writes the writeups?

You. Me. The whole gang. If you got a flag, write it down. I know, it is quite boring and takes a lot of time. But it is the core of the team to share solutions. Please check the CONTRIBUTING page at our repo for more detailed guidelines.

# Do I have to play every single contest?

Nope. We know you have stuff to do and a life to live (hopefully). Feel free to play whenever you feel like doing so. HOWEVER, a minimum commitment level is required.

# Can I be banned?

Yep. Just do not violate the Code of Conduct and you should be fine.

# I am not from Brazil, is that a problem?

Nope.

# My english is not very good and I do not feel comfortable with it

None of our members is a native speaker. If you can communicate, that should be enough. Nobody cares for your grammar mistakes :)
